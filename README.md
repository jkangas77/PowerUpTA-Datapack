# PowerUpTA-Datapack

Possible Flow
Week 1 - Covering what Datapacks can and can't do, learning the Minecraft file system, doing everything that can be done with a GUI capping at dimensions
1. Introduction to MCreator and Datapacks. 
    1. Have them install a datapack of our creation (~20 mins)
    1. Learn to use functions on it 
1. See if they can figure out why things happen in the files
1. Change cow's loot table from pork to diamonds
1. Creating a custom recipe and installing it
 Loot tables (Replace default + chests) + Intro to functions
Show them how to make a function repeat
show them how to give themselves materials off of a single function
Maybe show them how to have one function call another function
 Custom Mob-Spawning using a template
If we can make a file that summons from a file, they can use a generator
Custom structure spawning would be awesome assuming we can actually do it
 Creating a custom dimension + PvP Minigame start
Plus how to access it
Set up command block portals to get in-between them
Integrate custom mobs and maybe some wild weather effects like lightning strikes every so often
 PvP minigame using templates
Score-based
Using the custom mobs
Join teams and equip players when they use commands
Eg. 'join_red' would set their team to red, give them iron armor, and tp them to the red base
Play each others' games

Week 2 - Adventure Maps but with a lot more focus on the technical aspect
The execute command + command refresh (go over the simpler ones briefly)
Yeah, we're just going to dedicate a lot of time to it
Hub world but with datapacks; call functions from command blocks
Design adventure map / minigame
